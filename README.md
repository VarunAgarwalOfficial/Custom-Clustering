# Project Name: Color Quantization and Beyond


This project began as an initial experiment in color quantization using the K-means clustering algorithm. As the project evolved, further research led to the discovery of a new and more advanced technique for color quantization. At the time of the initial experiment, the improved technique was not well-defined, and the project was left in a state of transition.

The current focus of the project is on refining and implementing the newly researched technique for color quantization. This README.md file provides an overview of the project, its initial goals, the transition to a more advanced technique, and the ongoing efforts to enhance and publish the improved approach.
